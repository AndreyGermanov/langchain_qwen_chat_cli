Project 1 Submission Guidelines - Agentic AI Developer Certification (AAIDC-Week3)

Congratulations on completing Module 1 of the Agentic AI Developer Certification Program! Now it's time to demonstrate your learning through Project 1. This guide walks you through the exact steps to submit your RAG-based AI assistant project successfully.


üìã Technical Requirements
Before submitting, ensure your project meets these core requirements:

RAG-based AI assistant application - Your system must use Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Vector database integration - Incorporate a vector store (FAISS, Chroma, or alternatives) for document retrieval
Document corpus embedding - Embed a collection of documents (Ready Tensor publications, Wikipedia articles, or other permitted sources)
Working retrieval and response system - Demonstrate functional prompt ‚Üí retrieval ‚Üí response pipeline using LangChain
Submission Deadline ‚è∞
Project 1 submission is due by June 13, 2025, at 11:59 PM UTC

We strongly recommend submitting by June 12 to allow time for any last-minute adjustments.

üöÄ Step-by-Step Submission Process
Step 1: Create Your Publication
The team lead creates a new publication on the Ready Tensor platform describing your project.

Step 2: Add the Required Tag
Critical: Add the tag AAIDC2025 to your publication. Without this tag, we cannot identify your submission as part of the certification program.

Step 3: Add Co-Authors
Don't forget to add your teammates as co-authors to the publication. The team lead's name will appear as the first author.

Step 4: Link Your Code Repository
Upload your GitHub repository URL under the "Models" section of the publication. This is where evaluators will access your code.

Please store API keys and sensitive data in a .env file, ensure it's listed in .gitignore, and use a .env_example to share required variable names securely.

Step 5: Follow Best Practices
Ensure your publication follows Ready Tensor's best practices for AI/ML project documentation (see our published guidelines).

Step 6: Upload Supplementary Files
You can upload any additional relevant files (PDFs, datasets, documentation) to support your submission.

Step 7: Final Review and Submit
Complete your submission before the deadline!

You are encouraged to include a video demo of your app in your publication to enhance clarity and showcase your work more effectively. While this is not a requirement, it is a strong recommendation, as a video can serve as a valuable addition to your portfolio. You may record the application‚Äôs workflow, optionally include a brief presentation, and upload the video to your YouTube channel. Then, simply attach the video link to your written publication in Ready Tensor platform to improve its readability and overall impact.

üìù Publication Requirements Checklist
 Published on Ready Tensor platform
 Includes the AAIDC2025 tag
 Created by the team lead
 All teammates added as co-authors
 GitHub repository linked under "Models" section
 Repository follows best practices for AI/ML code repositories
 Documentation follows AI/ML project best practices
üíª Code Repository Requirements
Your GitHub repository must:

Follow best practices for AI/ML code development (see our published guidelines)
Be reproducible and runnable locally by our evaluation team
Include clear setup instructions, sample inputs, and expected outputs
Score 70% or higher on our 
repository evaluation rubric
Please ensure that API keys and other sensitive information are not exposed in your main GitHub repository or shared publicly. Instead, store such data in a .env file and make sure it is included in your .gitignore to prevent accidental uploads. For reproducibility, you should provide a .env_example file that outlines the required environment variables without revealing any real values. This practice helps maintain security while allowing others to understand how to set up the project properly. Thank you for following secure development practices.

üîç Evaluation Process
After submission, our team will:

Review your Ready Tensor publication
Clone and run your GitHub repository locally
Test the functionality of your RAG system
Evaluate against our technical and documentation rubrics
Provide feedback and certification status
üí° Key Reminders
Tag is mandatory: AAIDC2025 must be included in your publication
Team lead submits: Only the team lead creates the publication
Code must run: Ensure your repository is fully functional and reproducible
Meet the 70% threshold: Both publication and code must meet minimum quality standards
