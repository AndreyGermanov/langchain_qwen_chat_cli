Understanding Agentic AI: The Revolution in Artificial Intelligence
What is Agentic AI?
Over the past year, the AI landscape has been dominated by discussions around GenAI (Generative AI), Agentic AI, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems. But what exactly is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI is fundamentally the "autonomy engine" for AI systems. It represents the intelligence and methodology that enables AI systems to act independently (the "how" behind their ability to plan, decide, and execute tasks without constant human guidance). Think of it as the framework and mindset for building AI systems that truly "think for themselves."

Unlike traditional AI systems that follow strict, predefined rules, Agentic AI brings a proactive, goal-oriented approach to problem-solving. It's a significant shift from reactive systems to proactive ones that can take initiative.

AI Agents: The Building Blocks of Agentic AI
AI agents are systems powered by AI (typically Large Language Models or LLMS) that interact with software, data, and even hardware to achieve specific goals. They function as proactive problem-solvers who autonomously complete tasks, make decisions, and adapt to new information without micromanagement.

What sets AI agents apart from basic automation or chatbots?
It's their ability to:

Plan independently based on user input
Make decisions autonomously
Execute actions to achieve desired outcomes
AI agents operate using a looped decision-making process often referred to as OODA (Observeâ€“Orientâ€“Decideâ€“Act). At the core is a Large Language Model (LLM), often supported by memory, planning modules, and tool access. Here's how the cycle works:

Observe: Gather input from the environment. This could be user queries, documents, sensor data, or tool outputs.
Orient: Analyze the context, assess available tools, and understand whatâ€™s needed to solve the problem.
Decide: Select the next best action based on goals, constraints, and prior steps.
Act (Execute): Perform the action. This might mean calling a function, retrieving information, or interacting with another agent.
You can have a single agent working all by itself to complete tasks or multiple agents working together to complete a task. When you have multiple agents working together, it is called a multi-agent system.

Multi-Agent Systems (MAS): When Agents Collaborate
A multi-agent system (MAS) involves multiple AI agents working together to tackle tasks for a user or system. Instead of relying on a single "do-it-all" agent, MAS employs a team of specialised agents working collaboratively.

Thanks to their flexibility, scalability, and domain expertise of the different agents, multi-agent systems can solve complex real-world problems that might be too challenging for a single agent. Imagine you are the only one working on Apple Silicon - you will go mad before you can realise your goal. But if you have many other people helping you, tasks become easier, more managed, and faster. This is the advantage of multi-agent systems, which has made them increasingly popular.

Below, we are going to explore various multi-agent architectures:

MAS Architectures
1. Centralized Networks

In centralized networks, a central agent contains the global knowledge base, connects to all other agents, and oversees their information flow.

Strengths:

Easier communication between agents
Uniform knowledge distribution
Clear hierarchy and coordination
Weaknesses:

Dependent on the central agent
If the central agent fails, the entire system fails
Example: Like a conductor directing an orchestra, ensuring each musician plays their part correctly. Similarly, a CEO assigns specific tasks to team members based on their expertise and monitors overall progress.

2. Decentralized Networks

In decentralized networks, there's no central agent controlling information. Agents share information with their neighbours in a distributed manner.

Strengths:

Greater robustnessâ€”failure of one agent doesn't crash the system
More flexibility and modularity
Can handle more complex, distributed tasks
Weaknesses:

Coordination challenges
Potential inefficiencies in information sharing
More complex to design and implement
Example: A flock of birds adjusting flight patterns without a leader, each responding to its immediate neighbours. Similarly, independent workers coordinating through a shared platform, where each contributes their expertise without centralized management.

The choice between centralized and decentralized architectures depends on the specific requirements of the task, the reliability needs of the system, and the complexity of the environment in which the agents operate.
